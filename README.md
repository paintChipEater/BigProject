# BigProject

This project is the result of the dreams of two high school pseudo-programmers and one markup specialist (Will come in clutch). In the end, we hope to bring newspaper 
site to our school. 

Our frontend is constructed by the hard work of Henry and his React.js skills.

Our backend is primarily constructed by Saul and his initial insistance on local MongoDB due him being too cheap to pay for Atlas. Also built with a hint of Node.js
runtime environment and Express.js, which is the one library that has reduced our mental anguish by a longshot.
